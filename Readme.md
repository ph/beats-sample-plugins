Some test plugins for use with experimental plugin support in beats with go 1.8 compiler.

Requires at least go1.8 beta2, cgo enabled, and linux.

Go plugins require a go package to build. This project provides the main packages in the `./plugins` subdirectory.

Compile plugins via `go build -buildmode=plugin ./plugins/<name>`

A beats plugin exports all plugins by exporting the global variable `var Bundle map[string][]interface{}`. Using `plugin.Bundle`, multiple plugins/bundles can be composed into one common bundle.

Beats PR introducing plugin support: elastic/beats#3217

Plugins:

- myconsole: re-implements the console plugin. Configure via `output.myconsole.pretty: true`  in config file
- my_drop_fields: re-implements the `drop_fields` processor. For testing use `my_drop_fields` instead of `drop_fields`
- lookup: implements `lookup.exec` from [x-exec-lookup](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/x-exec-lookup) branch as plugin.
- all: `all` plugin bundles `myconsole`, `my_drop_fields`, and `lookup` into one dynamically loadable plugin.

## How to create a plugin

- The plugins have been generated by copying the original modules/packages from libbeat.
- remove the package init function, normally registering the package as processor/output plugin
- export the newXYZ function normally registered as plugin loader
- create a main package declaring the plugin via `processors.Plugin` or `outputs.Plugin` in the global `Bundle` variable (use of `plugin.Bundle` is optional).
